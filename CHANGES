-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4.3 beta
Pasha Paterson <draco@zerobandwidth.net>

Replaces 0.4.2 beta, introduces new floor objects.

2011-11-14

* (pack.c)
  When self-identification of weapons was added on 2011-10-18, it opened a
  loophole whereby any wieldable object -- including potions and wands --
  would self-identify.  The code has now been changed such that only true
  weapons will self-identify.
* (rogue.h, floorobject.c)
  Added two new types of floor objects.  The "analyzer" will attempt to
  identify an item, but might break or steal it instead.  The "fountain" will
  supply a certain number of doses of various potion types, not all of them
  good for you.  Now that there are multiple floor object types, the functions
  that create floor objects have been fully generalized.  New arrays of
  integers, defined locally in floorobject.c, specify the minimum level and
  base appearance chance of each type of floor object.
* (floorobject.*)
  fobj_transmutate() has been removed from general accessibility.
* (special_hit.*)
  Made the steal_gold() function accessible.  Also added a check to verify that
  the address of a monster was indeed passed in; otherwise, the disappear()
  function is not invoked to make the monster vanish.
* (use.*)
  In order to reuse the existing code for quaffing a potion, a new function
  apply_potion() was added.  The existing quaff() function for quaffing a
  bottled potion now calls apply_potion() to apply the potion's effects; the
  fountain floor object may also call this function to apply the effects of
  the fountain's contents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4.2 beta
Pasha Paterson <draco@zerobandwidth.net>

Replaces 0.4.1 alpha, starts beta release train on SourceForge.
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/zerogue/
  
2011-11-09

* (floorobject.c)
  Discovered and fixed a bug where an invalid item letter entry for an item-to-
  gold transmutation would throw a seg fault, because the null result was not
  caught by the surrounding logic until it was passed to vanish().

2011-10-24

* (room.c)
  By changing the way that floorobjects were classified, it became
  possible that a floor object might be placed but not visible on a level.
  This bug was corrected.

2011-10-20

* (play.c) Noticed ROGUE_KEY_VERSION and changed the version message.
* (floorobject.c) Separated the code for placing a transmutator out to new
  function put_transmutator().  Removed reference to place_at() from this code,
  since that has been adding duplicate objects to level_objects.  Oops.

2011-10-18

* [BUG] Encountered a weird error where the "setuid failed!" message ended
  up getting copied into the m_names[] table in place of "aquator".  This
  suggests some kind of really bizarre memory smash that will be difficult to
  diagnose.

* (message.c) Changed the way "HP" is displayed.
* (throw.c) Changed the message for a thrown potion that hits without taking
  effect.
* (floorobject.*, object.c, main.c)
  Separated code related to floor objects out of object.* and into new files
  floorobject.*.  Changed put_transmutator() into put_floor_objects() to make
  room for different kinds of floor objects.
* (rogue.h)
  Changed up the constants for floor objects.  Added several constants for the
  which_kind field in floor objects, planning for future types of floor
  objects.
* (pack.c)
  Weapons, like armor, self-identify when equipped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4.1 alpha
Pasha Paterson <draco@zerobandwidth.net>

Replaces 0.4.0 alpha, adds a bunch of crazy new stuff.

2011-10-17

* (score.c)
  Removed the code that prevents display of more than one score by the same
  user.  The top ten all-time scores for any player will now be saved, even if
  a single user has multiple scores.

2011-10-12

* (object.c)
  Changed the behavior of the transmutator.  For weapons and armor, items
  created by the transmutator are pre-identified.  For other item types, only
  those item kinds that have already been identified or called by the player
  are added to the pack.  Each make_*_pack() function now returns the number of
  items created, so that, if that number is zero, the transmutator gives a
  meaningful message and shuts down without offering its list of zero choices.
* (pack.c)
  Changed the way that pack_count() evaluates whether a rogue's pack is full,
  by considering anything that can stack under a pack letter as a single item.
  This is more similar to modern MMO inventory schemes, and frees a up a lot
  more room for the rogue to carry stuff.  This also fixes a bug where the
  player would be told his pack is full when trying to pick up food, but if the
  player then dropped a weapon, he could pick up the food and then pick up the
  weapon again.  Because there are far more kinds of items than there are rows
  on a default terminal (24), pack_count() includes a hard limit of DROWS,
  which ensures that the size of the rogue's pack will never exceed the game's
  ability to display its contents.
* (inventory.c, object.c)
  Corrected inventory display of stacked fruits.

2011-10-11

* (use.c, level.*, special_hit.c)
  Changed the behavior of drop_level() so that it doesn't change the rogue's
  actual level.  Instead, it applies "negative levels" that are factored into
  calculations of the rogue's "effective level".  To support this, a function
  get_rogue_level() has been added to level.* to handle the effective level
  calculation consistently, and take that logic out of all the many places
  where it's used.  This new function accounts for both the new expmod variable
  and the previously-defined ring_exp variable from ring.c.
* (appraise.c, hit.c, level.c, message.c, monster.c, move.c, special_hit.c,
   throw.c, trap.c, use.c, zap.c)
  Modified algorithms to use get_rogue_level() -- the rogue's "effective level"
  -- instead of just the level itself.
* (rogue.h, object.c, use.c, appraise.c)
  Added a RESTORE_LEVEL potion, which wipes out negative levels, if any.

2011-10-06

* (rogue.h) Lowered AMULET_LEVEL from 26 to 24.  Raised MAX_HP from 800 to 999.
* (rogue.h, main.c, message.*, move.c, object.*, room.c)
  Added the "transmutator" artifact, which can be used to convert items to gold
  and vice versa.  The gold value of an item is used to convert items; these
  values were already present in the id_*[] tables for each item type, and can
  be evaluated by get_value() in score.c.  When the rogue bumps into the trans-
  mutator, it gives the choice to trade [g]old or [i]tems.  If trading gold, it
  presents an interface for selecting an item to "buy".  If trading an item, it
  takes that item and gives back that item's gold value.  The transmutator is
  part of a new FLOOROBJECT class of dungeon objects.
* (use.c) Changed behavior of the INCREASE_STRENGTH potion, such that it always
  boosts max strength by 1 and current strength by 1, even if they're
  different.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4.0 alpha
Pasha Paterson <draco@zerobandwidth.net>

This version represents a branch from LinuxRogue 0.3.2 by Ashwin N.
This branch introduces new gameplay elements which take zerogue down a path
toward being a separate roguelike game, distinct from the original rogue.

2011-10-05

* (use.c, monster.c) A monster created by a scroll is briefly confused.
* (use.c) A rogue using a scroll of teleportation for the first time is
  briefly confused.
* (trap.c) A rogue teleported by a trap is briefly confused.
* (trap.c) Disarming a trap is now a countable operation, like searching.
* (appraise.c) Corrected a cut-and-paste error that gave the same message for
  normal vs. enchanted weapons.
* (special_hit.c) Removed a goto from steal_item(object*).
* (hit.c) Removed char* mn as a local variable in mon_damage(object*,short).
  The variable is given a value later in the function, but that value is never
  used by anything.
* (special_hit.c) Added a global variable stolen_gold to track the amount of
  gold stolen by leprechauns.  This variable represents a "pot" of gold into
  which all the stolen gold is placed.  When a leprechaun is killed, the rogue
  gets all the gold in the pot, and the cycle starts over.  If there is no
  gold in the pot when a leprechaun is killed, a single gold piece is dropped.
* (object.c) Fruit is now stackable.
* (room.c) Changed display character for Amulet of Yendor from comma (',') to
  dollar sign ('$').

2011-10-04

* (inventory.c) Changed the way that armor information is displayed.  An
  identified suit of armor will have its bonus displayed as [N] where N is the
  armor's bonus.  A protected suit of armor will be shown as [N+].  A cursed
  suit of armor will be shown as [N-].
* (trap.c) Changed the message for disarmed trap.
* (use.c) Totally changed the way that sleep scrolls work.  If you read a
  sleep scroll that has been identified, and there are any monsters within two
  spaces of the rogue, those monsters take a nap, as if hit by a wand/staff of
  sleep.  If there are no monsters around, or if the scroll hasn't yet been
  identified, the rogue falls asleep instead.

2011-06-10
* (level.c) Changed add_exp() so that, if the rogue's level increases, then
  the rogue's HP is raised to max, similar to the "Ding!" effect in modern
  MMORPGs, etc.

2011-05-26
* (throw.c) Added code such that a status-effecting potion that hits a monster
  will be identified if its effect hits.

2011-05-19
* (rogue.h, trap.h, trap.c, play.c) Added a new "Disarm" command, allowing a
  player to attempt to disarm a trap that is visible.
* (zap.c) Changed duration of PUT_TO_SLEEP wands from 1d4+2 to 1dL+2.
* (trap.c, move.c) Tried to fix some possible seg-fault errors with disarmed
  traps.  Eventually found the bug in the search() function, where a trap of
  type NO_TRAP (-1) would throw a seg-fault when used as the array index for
  trap_strings[].
* (throw.c) Fixed some messages for wands.  Also fixed effect when hitting a
  monster with a hallucination or confusion potion -- the CONFUSED flag was not
  being set.
* (score.h, score.c) Renamed xxxx(char*,int) as name_cipher(char*,int), and
  renamed xxx(boolean) as char_cipher(boolean).
* (move.c) Inserted some comments explaining the inner workings of heal().
  Fixed the bug that would cause the player's HP to be reduced to max (losing
  temporary HP from the potion) after the player moved one heal increment's
  worth of steps.  Judging from pre-existing comments, Ashwin tuned up the
  healing speed with "alt", which would cause the algorithm to alternate
  between +1 and +2 HP.  I've removed that switch (and its supporting static
  variable). 

2011-05-18
* (inventory.c) Added logic in get_desc() to indicate whether a suit of armor
  has been protected, and thus immune to rusting.  A "[+]" is appended after
  the armor class indication.
* (ring.c, move.c) The original code for food consumption depended on an extern
  counter e_rings defined in ring.c, which counted the number of rings that
  were equipped.  Each ring would increase food consumption by 50%; two rings
  effectively doubled food consumption.  I've replaced the e_rings concept with
  the variable r_hunger, which acts as a multiplier for food consumption.  Each
  normal ring increases hunger by a new constant RING_HUNGER_FACTOR.  The ring
  of "slow digestion" now acts as a ring of "sustenance", changing the hunger
  multiplier to zero.
* (keys.qwerty.h) Changed wizard's key for "create new object" from \177 (del)
  to \006 (Ctrl-F).  When accessing Linux remotely, processing of the Delete
  key can be unreliable.
* (move.c) While working on the reformulation of hunger and rings, I had added
  a modified hunger stat display that would show the value of rogue.moves_left
  and a one-character hungry/weak/faint flag.  This is TMI for a normal
  player, but I've left it in place for Wizard Mode.
* (pack.c) Continued messing with status messages for dropped items.
* (pack.c) Enhanced check_duplicate(object*,object*) such that, if the player
  picks up a stackable weapon (arrow, dagger, dart, or shuriken), and the
  item is identical to a weapon of the same type, then the stacks will be
  merged.  This will collapse, for example, two stacks of +0,+0 arrows, even
  if they originated in different quivers.
* (object.h, object.c, pack.c) In the process, I discovered that the weapon
  stack evaluation logic in check_duplicate also appears in the
  pack_count(object*) function that figures out whether you can pick something
  up off the floor.  In order to condense that nasty logic into one place, two
  new functions, is_stackable(object*) and could_stack_items(object*,object*),
  have been added.

2011-05-17
* (use.c) Adjusted amount of HP healed by healing potions.  Since the rogue's
  max HP is raised by 1d8+2 per level, and healing potions shouldn't be free
  passes for recklessness, I've changed the formula to Ld6+L, where L is the
  rogue's experience level.  (Sorry, D&D fans, Ld8+L is just too powerful
  here, especially for extra-healing potions that can take you over max.)
* (throw.c) Added logic to throw_at_monster(object*,object*) allowing certain
  potions to transfer their effects to monsters when thrown.
* (zap.c) Cleaned up some status messages.  Also added status messages to
  successful zap actions, allowing the player to guess what a zap weapon's
  effect might be, even if it hasn't been identified.
* (appraise.c, play.c, rogue.h) Added the appraise() function, which adds the
  "appraise" command.  This command allows a player to try to figure out what
  an item might do, without having a scroll of identify.  The appraisal
  messages for most items are non-unique, so it's not as definite as real 
  identification.
* (move.c) Cleaned up messages regarding "fainting".
* (pack.c) Cleaned up some status messages.
* (use.c) Changed prototype for idntfy() to identify_item(short).  The
  argument allows a character to be passed into the function from appraise(),
  when the player lucks out and gets a "perfect" appraisal.
* (rogue.h) Added PERFECT_APPRAISAL_CHANCE, allowing the developer to tune the
  effectiveness of the "appraise" command.

2011-05-16
* (*.c) Started trying to purge goto statements.
* (hit.c) Enhanced hit messages to show damage dealt.
* (throw.c) Enhanced hit messages to show damage dealt.
* (inventory.c) Extended get_desc() with a boolean parameter to specify whether
  the first letter of the item's description should be capitalized.
* (monster.c) Adjusted rattlesnake damage from 2d5 to 1d2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.2
2004-05-02
Ashwin N. <ashwin@despammed.com>

Miguel G. C. <mgcuadrado@indra.es>
* Extended out the QWERTY specific key mapping into a generic configuration.
  Added support for DVORAK key mapping.

Ashwin N. <ashwin@despammed.com>
* Removed all (ancient) UNIX specific idiosyncracies in machdep.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3
2004-02-15
Ashwin N. <ashwin@despammed.com>

Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>
* Header files added for all source files. #includes of these files added
  to all source files to replace the former dirty way of using externs.
* Makefile
  Prerequisites are generated automatically. Needs some more work.
* Corrected tons of punctuation mistakes in the messages displayed to the
  player.
* static on functions removed. It was unnecessary in the first place.
* Unused extern variable declarations removed.
* Lots of beautification of code (mostly on braces).
* shorts converted to ints in lots of places.
* spec_hit.c file renamed to special_hit.c

Chris
* hit.c
  Integer math bug fixed in damage to armor.
* inventory.c
  The output is always sorted by the selection letter. The other change allows
  you to select an item from the inventory viewing screen. The second is how
  the old inventory() function ended up moved to inv_sel() with inventory()
  just becoming a call to inv_sel() with arguments.
* monster.c
  Added a function fix_mon_damage. This function corrects the damage pointer
  when loading a saved game for a monster. Prior to this fix, monsters already
  present on a level when saved were restored with random damage amounts. Most
  commonly unable to hit the player due to their damage being 0.
* move.c
  My changes are an attempt to enable following of tunnels between rooms. It
  gets a little funny when you are in one of those maze style rooms but works
  for the most part. Following of turns in the tunnels is only active for
  control and a direction. Such as ^H.
* object.c
  The weapon equivalent of the monster fix. It was very annoying to restore a
  saved game and suddenly only be able to hit a monster with the damage for
  your strength.
* pack.c
  Contains the remainder of the changes to allow selection during inventory
  display.
* play.c
  The changes to allow the / command to identify characters on the screen as
  per rogue-guide.txt.
* save.c
  Added code to call the functions to fix monster and weapon damages when
  restoring a saved file.
* rogue-guide.txt
  High bit characters changed to normal chars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.2
2004-01-15
Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>

* V0.2.1 carried a corrupted AUTHORS file. The file has been repaired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.1
2003-03-09
Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>

Lots of fixes in 0.2.1. Most of the Segmentation Faults should disappear now.

* After seeking help (using ?) the dungeon map used to disappear. This is
  fixed.
* get_input_line was being called with the wrong parameters in lots of places.
  All of them are fixed. No more silly Segmentation Faults that were being
  reported should occur.
* Password has been changed from an eccentric one to "password"
* Command to create objects in wizard mode was Ctrl-C, now changed to Ctrl-/

  (Thanks to Matt <mattk@cyberonic.com> for pointing out all the above bugs
  and their fixes too.)

* Karl-Olov Serrander reported problems with getlogin() in function md_gln()
  under RH8. Replaced it with getpwnam() as he suggested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2
2003-02-21
Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>

* The inbuilt curses/termlib emulation code (for systems which don't have
  ncurses) has been removed.
* All register variables changed to normal.
* All function declaration and definitions ANSI-fied from the old K&R style.
* All warnings fixed (a ton of them used to show up if I compiled with -Wall).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verison: 0.1

* The latest version I could get my hands on when I looked for a Linux port of
  Rogue.
